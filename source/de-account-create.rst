Create your Drone-Engage Account Key
====================================

To get access to Drone-Engage you need to register and get **Access Code** from `Account Manager <http://droneengage.com:8021/accounts.html>`_.
This is a very straight forward step. You will recieve an **Access Code** on your email that you need to save and use in all your drones.
In case you have `Andruav <https://www.andruav.com>`_ account, you can still use it with Drone-Engage as well.

To validate your new account please login to `Drone-Engage Web Client <https://droneengage.com:8021/webclient.html>`_.

.. tip::
    You only need one accound for all your drones.
