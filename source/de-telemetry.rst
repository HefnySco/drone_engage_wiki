   Drone-Engage Web Plugin </de-web-plugin>
   



Drone-Engage integrates with `Ardupilot-based flight control boards <https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-autopilots.html>`_. Drone-Engage can connect to these boards via Serial, Bluetooth, Wifi, USB, TCP and UDP connections.

While the second is captured in Egypt

Both are the same exact video filmed from two places.

.. tip::

   **Andruav 12,193 km RC Car Demo** :ref:`here <de-telemetry>` is done by connecting joystick to Mission Planner via Andruav Telemetry. However it is recommended to use `GamePad Directly <https://andruav.com/andruav-gamepad.html>`_.


Although the video was made using Andruav at that time. Drone-Engage is even more capable and more optimized for this types of missions.
