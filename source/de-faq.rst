#. I Do Not Understand Many Terminologies in This Site.
    Please access :ref:`de-glossary` page.

#. I Cannot Get my Accesscode.
    Sometimes the access code is filtered out in spam folder. Please check it.

#. How Many Drones and GCS Can be connected simultanously ?
    Theoretically unlimited. It depends on your network quality and type of data you transfer, it also depends on your Drone devices. For high response time you need to use better Andruav-Drone quality devices.

#. What is group and why it is 1?
    Drone-Engage Group refers to group of drones & GCS that interact with each other. An Drone-Engage account can have multiple groups. Different groups cannot be interacted with each other. By default, this feature is disabled in Andruav, you can enable it from the "Settings Menu", and by default you have one group and its number is "1".

#. What is Web-Plugin
    Web Plugin is a small appplication that can run on Windows or Ubuntu. It allows you to connect Drone-Engage WebClient to Mission Planner, QGround Control or any GCS without the need to use Andruav GCS mobile app. You can use Telemetry directly from Web. Please check :ref:`de-web-plugin` for more details.

#. Smart Telemetry Levels
    Smart Telemetry is a feature in Drone-Engage that enables it to use less bandwidth when sending telemetry data. This is useful for your data subscription package. It enables you to get good performance with slower networks. Different levels means lesser packets being sent and some non important packets are being almost filtered. The high the level the less the bandwidth and connection speed required as well as the less screen update on GCS.
